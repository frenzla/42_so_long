# 42_so_long

This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make me work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.
Moreover, it's the first C project for which I create a visual interface.

For detailed information, refer to [the subject of this project](https://github.com/frenzla/42_so_long/blob/main/so_long_subject.pdf).

Part of my coding mastering journey ðŸ¥·


## 42

[42 is a world class computer programming school](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) that proposes a new way of learning computer science:
- No teachers
- No classrooms
- Open 24/7, 365 days/year
- Students are trained through peer-to-peer pedagogy, and project-based learning.
- Methodology that develops both tech & life skills.
- The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process.


## How to Install and Run the Project 

- `git clone` [MinilibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux), the X-Window (X11R6) programming API used for the graphics.
- `git clone` the project
- Change the `MINI_LIB_PATH` in the project's [Makefile](https://github.com/frenzla/42_so_long/blob/main/Makefile) to where you cloned the MinilibX.
